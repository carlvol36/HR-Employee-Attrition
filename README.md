This project has been built on the HR attrition data provided by the HR team and we have used machine learning to understand the trends in terms of attrition of employees in the organization.
The data was sourced from the HRMS where it provided the details of all employees that have left the company for the last 15 years.
In this project, the outcome was a classification to understand the reasons for attrition.
